Code for "Postoperative Radiotherapy May be Unnecessary for Completely Resected Masaoka/Masaoka-Koga Stage II Thymoma in Asian Patients: A Chinese Alliance for Research in Thymomas Database Study and Literature Review"

Introduction: 
We intend to test the hypothesis that postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) didnâ€™t bring better outcomes for Masaoka/Masaoka-Koga (MK) stage II thymoma in Asian patients.

Methods
The Chinese Alliance for Research in Thymomas (ChART) retrospective database was reviewed. A propensity-score matched (PSM) analysis was conducted to balance the baseline characteristics between the PORT and non-PORT groups. Moreover, we systematically searched four online databases and included studies that compared surgery alone versus surgery plus a PORT for completely resected MK stage II thymoma in Asian patients.

Results
A total of 432 MK stage II thymoma patients were finally included from 3814 thymic epithelial tumor patients in the database between 1994 to 2021. In contrast to the group without PORT, the patients in the PORT group exhibited no significant overall survival (OS) benefits no matter whether before PSM analysis (HR = 0.17, P = 0.058) or after (HR = 0.28, P = 0.24) (Figure 1). In addition, three studies in the last ten years including 1509 MK stage II thymoma patients met our selection criteria. Comprehensive literature reviewing those studies confirmed that PORT was associated with no better OS (China study: P = 0.618; Korea study: P = 0.839; Japan study: P = 0.819). Besides, the 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were similar between the two groups (80% vs 72%, P = 0.445) in the China study. No statistical difference of 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates between the two groups was observed in the Korean study (96.3% vs 96.6%, P = 0.622) and the Japan study (93.4% vs 92.3%, P = 0.458).

Conclusions: 
Our study revealed that postoperative radiotherapy may not be recommended in Asian patients diagnosed with Masaoka/Masaoka-Koga stage II thymoma after complete resection.
